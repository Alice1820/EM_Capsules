This is a Pytorch implementation of EM Capsules in the paper "Matrix capsules with EM routing"

The code is based on this repository: https://github.com/shzygmyx/Matrix-Capsules-pytorch
But one improvement is that replacing all for loops in routing by matrix multiplication

Therefore, the performance is much better than the original code.

For instruction, read the main.py for options when training.
